                                    support for the World Bank to assess the effectiveness of agricultural subsidies on smallholder

                                    policy in Zambia, and reviewed and developed a roadmap for implementing community-based
                                    initiatives in South Africa. The company also conducts policy briefings aimed at influencing
                                    policymakers, such as the investment case for Zimbabwean youth conducted by Dr. Muyengwa
                                    for UNICEF and the Zimbabwe Youth Council in 2014 and 2015. The specific assignment entailed
                                    a desk review to summarize the situation of the youth concerning livelihoods and empowerment
                                    based on the National Youth Policy. We have also produced several policy briefs for the Africa
